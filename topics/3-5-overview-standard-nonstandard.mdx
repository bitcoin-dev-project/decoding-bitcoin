## Standard Script

Standard scripts in bitcoin are predefined and widely accepted transaction scripts.

They are well-tested and secure and nodes can quickly verify and relay them.

Below is a time line showing different output scripts types before and After Segwit:

    Bitcoin Core will only relay transactions by default that pass the

    check. However, miners are still free to include (valid!) non-standard
    transactions in their blocks.

## Non-Standard Script

Non-standard scripts in bitcoin are scripts that do not follow the commonly used templates for transactions.

Standard scripts, such as Pay-to-PubKey-Hash (P2PKH) and Pay-to-Script-Hash (P2SH), are widely recognized and accepted by nodes on the bitcoin network.

Any script that deviates from these templates is considered non-standard and it will not be relayed by the network.

They are valid but are not relayed by most nodes for safety reasons

    To use a non-standard script, wrap your non-standard output scripts in
    p2sh/p2wsh output scripts. This makes your transaction appear standard and
    ensures it gets relayed and mined.
