Just like software updates labeled as v1.0, v2.0, v3.0, Bitcoin transactions use version numbers to indicate which features they support.

<TransactionCreation enabledFields={["version"]} />

1. **Version 1:** The original transaction format that follows basic Bitcoin transaction rules.

2. **Version 2:** Introduced in BIP68, BIP112, and BIP113, enabling:

    - **OP_CHECKSEQUENCEVERIFY (CSV)**: Allows relative timelock constraints
    - **Relative lock-time**: Prevents spending until a certain number of blocks have passed
    - **Median-time-past**: Uses median timestamp of previous 11 blocks for time-based locks

3. **Version 3:** Introduced to prevent transaction pinning attacks

    Don't worry if these new terms seem complex - we'll cover timelocks, CSV
    operations, and more in detail in later sections!

## Encoding

The version is stored as a 4-byte integer in **little-endian** format. For example:

-   Hex: `01000000` → Version: `1`
-   Hex: `02000000` → Version: `2`

Most transactions today use version 1 or 2, with version 2 being necessary when using relative timelocks or CSV operations.
