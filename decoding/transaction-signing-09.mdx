This guide covers three common transaction errors and their solutions:

1. `mandatory-script-verify-flag-failed` (Signature must be zero for failed CHECK(MULTI)SIG operation)
2. `mandatory-script-verify-flag-failed` (Script evaluated without error but finished with a false/empty top stack element)
3. `reject-reason: missing-input`

When encountering these errors, use this checklist to debug the issue:

| #   | Verification Check                                                                             |
| --- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 1   | Validate the transaction ID (txid) is correctly reversed for use in inputs                     |
| 2   | Ensure the amount field matches the UTXO value in satoshis (8 decimal places)                  |
| 3   | Check the scriptCode is prefixed with its length byte when used in the transaction commitment  |
| 4   | Include a 0x00 byte as the first witness element for CHECKMULTISIG bug workaround              |
| 5   | Verify P2WPKH witness program: prepend `OP_0 OP_PUSHBYTES_20`                                  |
| 6   | Verify P2WSH witness program: prepend `OP_0 OP_PUSHBYTES_32`                                   |
| 7   | Verify witness signature SIGHASH_ALL flag: `0x01` (one byte)                                   |
| 8   | Verify transaction commitment SIGHASH_ALL flag: `\x01\x00\x00\x00` (four bytes, little-endian) |
| 9   | Test with known test vectors (e.g., BIP143 examples)                                           |
| 10  | Verify that the signature matches the public key associated with the UTXO                      |
| 11  | Check that sum of inputs ≥ sum of outputs + fees                                               |
| 12  | Ensure double SHA256 hashing is performed before signing                                       |
| 13  | The scriptCode must be prefixed with its length byte when adding to the commitment hash        |
| 14  | Bitcoin requires double SHA256 hashing before signing                                          |
