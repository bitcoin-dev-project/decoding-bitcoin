Imagine receiving bitcoin but the transaction is stuck in the mempool.  
The sender used a fee that's too low, and miners aren't picking it up.

What can you do? This is where Child Pays For Parent (CPFP) comes in.


## What is CPFP?

CPFP is a fee-bumping strategy where the recipient of an unconfirmed transaction creates a new transaction (child) that spends the pending funds and includes a high enough fee to incentivize miners to confirm both transactions together.


## How Does CPFP Work?

Let's break it down with an example:

1. Alice sends 1 BTC to Bob with a very low fee
2. The transaction gets stuck in the mempool because miners ignore low-fee transactions
3. Bob creates a new transaction (child) spending the unconfirmed bitcoin
4. Bob attaches a high fee to the child transaction
5. Miners see they can collect both fees by including both transactions
6. Both transactions get confirmed in the next block

## Technical Details

CPFP works because of two key Bitcoin concepts:

1. **UTXO Model**: Bitcoin allows spending unconfirmed outputs, enabling the creation of child transactions
2. **Mempool Package Evaluation**: Miners evaluate related transactions as a package, considering their combined size and fees

### Fee Calculation

The effective fee rate for a CPFP package is:

<div className="text-center my-4 text-orange-500">
  $$\text{Effective Fee Rate} = \frac{\text{Parent Fee + Child Fee}}{\text{Parent Size + Child Size}}$$
</div>

CPFP is particularly useful when:
- You receive a transaction with too low fees
- The sender didn't enable RBF (Replace-By-Fee)
- You need urgent confirmation of incoming funds

## Limitations

While powerful, CPFP has some constraints:
- Only the recipient can initiate CPFP
- Requires enough funds to cover the new transaction fee
- Some wallets don't support CPFP natively
- May not work during extreme network congestion
