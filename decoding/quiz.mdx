## Ex 1: Opcodes

Challenge your understanding of Bitcoin opcodes.

<Quiz
    questions={[
        {
            question:
                "What is the main difference between OP_CHECKMULTISIG and OP_CHECKMULTISIGVERIFY?",
            options: [
                "OP_CHECKMULTISIGVERIFY supports more signatures",
                "OP_CHECKMULTISIG works with P2SH, while OP_CHECKMULTISIGVERIFY doesn't",
                "OP_CHECKMULTISIGVERIFY fails the script if the check fails, while OP_CHECKMULTISIG pushes a boolean result",
                "OP_CHECKMULTISIG is for legacy addresses, OP_CHECKMULTISIGVERIFY is for segwit"
            ],
            correctAnswer:
                "OP_CHECKMULTISIGVERIFY fails the script if the check fails, while OP_CHECKMULTISIG pushes a boolean result",
            explanation:
                "OP_CHECKMULTISIGVERIFY is equivalent to OP_CHECKMULTISIG followed by OP_VERIFY. It will cause the script to fail immediately if the multisig check fails, whereas OP_CHECKMULTISIG pushes true or false to the stack, allowing for more flexible script constructions."

## Ex 2: Locking and Unlocking

Let’s see how well you understand the core concepts of locking and unlocking scripts, which are key to securing and spending Bitcoin transactions.

<Quiz
    questions={[
        {
            question: "What is another name for a Locking Script?",
            options: ["ScriptSig", "Witness", "ScriptPubKey", "OP_CHECKSIG"],
            correctAnswer: "ScriptPubKey",
            explanation:
                "The Locking Script is also known as a ScriptPubKey. It is used to define the conditions under which an output can be spent."
        },
        {
            question:
                "Which part of a Bitcoin transaction contains the Unlocking Script?",

                "The input",
                "The output",

                "The coinbase"
            ],
            correctAnswer: "The input",
            explanation:
                "The Unlocking Script is provided for every input you want to spend in a transaction. It contains the necessary data to satisfy the conditions of the corresponding Locking Script."
        },
        {
            question:
                "In what order are the scripts executed when validating a transaction?",
            options: [
                "Locking Script first, then Unlocking Script",
                "Unlocking Script first, then Locking Script",
                "Both are executed simultaneously",
                "They are not executed during validation"
            ],
            correctAnswer: "Unlocking Script first, then Locking Script",
            explanation:
                "The Unlocking Script is executed first, and its result is then passed to the Locking Script. If the Locking Script is satisfied, the transaction is considered valid."
        },
        {
            question:
                "What happens if the Unlocking Script does not satisfy the Locking Script?",
            options: [
                "The transaction is added to the blockchain with a penalty",
                "The transaction is discarded and not added to the blockchain",
                "The transaction fee is increased",
                "The transaction is sent back for re-validation"
            ],
            correctAnswer:
                "The transaction is discarded and not added to the blockchain",
            explanation:
                "If the Unlocking Script does not satisfy the Locking Script, the transaction is considered invalid and is not added to the blockchain."
        },
        {
            question:
                "Which of the following is NOT true about a Locking Script?",

                "It is also known as a ScriptSig",
                "It can include cryptographic operations like OP_CHECKSIG"
            ],
            correctAnswer: "It is also known as a ScriptSig",
            explanation:
                "The Locking Script is not known as a ScriptSig; that term refers to the Unlocking Script. The Locking Script is known as a ScriptPubKey."

## Ex 4: Script Success and Failure

This quiz will test your understanding of what makes a Bitcoin script valid or invalid, focusing on the conditions that lead to script success or failure.

<Quiz
    questions={[
        {
            question:
                "What determines the success or failure of a script after execution?",

            ],
            correctAnswer: "The final value left on top of the stack",
            explanation:
                "After the script executes, the success or failure is determined by the final value on top of the stack. A non-zero value signifies success, while zero indicates failure."
        },

                "The stack contains more than one element after execution",
            explanation:
                "If more than one element remains on the stack after execution, the script is considered invalid."
