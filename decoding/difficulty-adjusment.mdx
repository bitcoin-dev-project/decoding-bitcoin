Bitcoin's difficulty adjustment mechanism is one of its most important features, ensuring that blocks are mined at a relatively consistent rate regardless of how much mining power (hashrate) is on the network.

## How Does Difficulty Adjustment Work?

Every 2,016 blocks (approximately 2 weeks), Bitcoin automatically adjusts its mining difficulty based on how quickly blocks were mined in the previous period:

- If blocks were mined too quickly (less than 10 minutes on average), difficulty increases
- If blocks were mined too slowly (more than 10 minutes on average), difficulty decreases
- The maximum adjustment is limited to 4x increase or 1/4x decrease

This self-correcting mechanism helps maintain Bitcoin's predictable issuance schedule and ensures network security remains proportional to mining investment.

## Why is Difficulty Adjustment Important?

1. **Predictable Issuance**: Keeps block times around 10 minutes, maintaining Bitcoin's planned supply schedule
2. **Network Security**: Adjusts difficulty to match total network hashpower
3. **Mining Economics**: Helps balance mining profitability as hardware efficiency improves
4. **Decentralization**: Allows Bitcoin to adapt to changing network conditions without central coordination

## Technical Details

The difficulty adjustment formula is: 

```
new_difficulty = current_difficulty * (actual_timespan / target_timespan)
```


Where:
- `target_timespan` = 2,016 blocks * 10 minutes = 20,160 minutes (2 weeks)
- `actual_timespan` = time taken for last 2,016 blocks (measured in seconds)
- `actual_timespan` is constrained between 1/4 and 4 times the target to limit volatility

### Key Components

1. **Target (nBits)**
   - A 256-bit number that a block hash must be below
   - Inversely proportional to difficulty
   - Stored in compact format in block headers

2. **Block Time**
   - Target average: 10 minutes
   - Natural variance due to mining's probabilistic nature
   - Measured over 2,016 block periods

3. **Adjustment Period**
   - Every 2,016 blocks (≈ 2 weeks at 10 min/block)
   - Fixed schedule based on block height
   - No adjustments between periods

## Network Hashrate

The network hashrate can be derived from the current difficulty:

```
hashrate ≈ difficulty * 2^32 / 600
```


This gives us the approximate hashes per second (H/s) being performed by all miners. The actual hashrate may vary due to:
- Mining luck (statistical variance)
- Changes in active mining equipment
- Network latency and orphaned blocks
